## Microsoft Edge Stable Portable with Chrome++ Auto Installer

No installation or setup required. Keeps all history, cookies, extensions, and settings even when moved to another device.

**Script features:**

* Downloads the latest Edge Stable x64 from [edge\_installer](https://github.com/bibicadotnet/edge_installer)
* Integrates Chrome++ for extra features
* Extracts to `C:\Edge_Portable` (default location)
* Cleans up temporary files after completion

**Run directly in PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://go.bibica.net/edge_portable | iex
```

**Or download the pre-built [release](https://github.com/bibicadotnet/microsoft-edge-portable/releases/latest)**, extract, and start using immediately.

### ⚠ Virus warning?

Due to the way Microsoft Edge is bypassed to run as a portable app, Microsoft Defender Antivirus may falsely flag it as a trojan.

If this happens, allow/whitelist the file and wait for Microsoft Defender’s definitions to update and remove the false positive.
